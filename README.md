# Statistic_Analisis

### This is my first full software developed. It's based on C# and uses MathNet.Numerics to most of calculations. It analyzes a sample of values and return a bunch of statistic results as descriptives statistics, outliers, charts, histograms, probabilities. Also has a stopwach in case you wish to collect the sample.
